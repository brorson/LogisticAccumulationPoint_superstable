The code in this directory was aimed at using first Newton's method
on x followed by Picard iteration on lambda to find the lambda
values at each superstable point.  Then find the limit to get
the accumulation point.
    
This approach fails since I can't use Picard iteration
on the slope condition.  The reason is that by definition one
of the xn values is 1/2, so the slope computation is zero naturally,
and I can't use it to compute lambda.
