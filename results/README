These are the results I obtained when computing the logistic map
period-2 accumulation point lambda_inf.  These results were obtained
by computing the sequence of superstable points for each period n =
2^m.  The files were computed using different precision settings in
MPFR. 

After computing the sequence using the C++ program in the parent
directory, I used the Python program in this directory to perform a
sequence acceleration calculation.

The C++ algorithm described in the parent directory scales as O(2^m),
which is exponentially bad.  Therefore, getting high-precision results
requires a balance between desiring a large number of digits (MPFR
precision) and waiting long enough to get results for high m.  
The sweet spot is the calculation which gives the most digits and
highest period while not taking literally weeks and weeks to complete.
My best results were obtained at precision 600.  At this precision I
was able to go to period n = 2^38.  That calculation took about 4
weeks. That result is in the file results_superstable_prec600.txt. 

Applying epsilon acceleration to that result I was able to get the
following approximation to lambda_inf:

3.569945671870944901842005151386498936763836911514832378107975529921362887500136777526321034216331

This is two more digits than are available from the OEIS
(https://oeis.org/A098587), which is

3.5699456718709449018420051513864989367638369115148323781079755299213628875001367775263210342163

My compiled results are contained in the file ResultsTable.odt.
